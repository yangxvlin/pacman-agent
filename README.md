# pacman-agent

## TODO
1. Heuristic Search Algorithms (using general or pacman specific heuristic functions)
2. Classsical Planning (PDDL and calling a classical planner, see subsection)
3. Policy iteration or Value Iteration (Model-Based MDP)
4. Monte Carlo Tree Search or UCT (Model-Free MDP)
5. Reinforcement Learning ¨C classical, approximate or deep Q-learning (Model-Free MDP)
6. Goal Recognition techniques (to infer intentions of opponents)
7. Game Theoretic Methods

## my notes
1. customize agent for team ```--delay 0.0 -r teams/team_heuristic_search/myTeam.py --redOpts=first=DummyAgent,second=DummyAgent -b teams/team_heuristic_search/myTeam.py```
